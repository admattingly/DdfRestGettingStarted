# Getting Started with RESTful Web Services Support in the Distributed Data Facility of DB2 for z/OS
_The easiest way on the planet to create RESTful Web Services!_
## Overview
This recipe walks you through a minimal configuration of the Distributed Data Facility (DDF) of DB2 for z/OS V11 or V12 to support the provision of RESTful Web Services. A simple Web Service is created and tested using the UNIX cURL command.
## Ingredients
- DB2 for z/OS version 12, or DB2 for z/OS version 11 with APAR PI66828 (Note: update APAR PI70477 now available)
- Access to any UNIX environment with the "cURL" command installed (doesn't have to be z/OS UNIX)

A complete description of the process for configuring DDF and managing RESTful services can be found in the DB2 Knowledge Center:
